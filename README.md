### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project. 
Is how to style the element to be in center of the body with FlexBox  

```css

.flex-container {
      display: flex;
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
      background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%) ;
      justify-content: center;
      padding: 70px 20px;
          }
```
style the qr image to take his place in the box 
```css
img{
  border-radius: 10px;
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
using a goole font
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
font-family:'Outfit', sans-serif;
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing in future projects on Practis more HTML and CSS Than learn JavaSqript
